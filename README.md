# Robot_Rtab_maping
This project uses RTAB-Map (Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping) in ROS to enable a mobile robot to perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The robot can localize itself within an unknown environment while building detailed 2D occupancy grids and 3D point cloud maps in real time.

ðŸ”¹ Features:-
1.RTAB-Map SLAM â€“ Efficient graph-based SLAM for real-time mapping.

2.Localization â€“ Robot estimates its position using visual and LIDAR/depth data.

3.2D + 3D Mapping â€“ Generates occupancy grids for navigation and 3D reconstructions for visualization.

4.ROS Integration â€“ Fully integrated with ROS (RViz, Gazebo, Navigation stack).

5.Sensor Fusion â€“ Supports RGB-D camera, stereo vision, and LIDAR.<img width="1300" height="775" alt="rtab" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bc916cc-3d70-44c7-8fab-ee34310e9f51" />
